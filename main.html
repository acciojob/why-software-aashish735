	<h1>Why Software?</h1>
  <p>I chose to pursue a career in software development because of my passion for technology and problem-solving. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that software can create and the impact it can have on our world. The ability to design, build, and create something from scratch is incredibly rewarding to me. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field and contributing to innovative projects that make a difference.</p>
